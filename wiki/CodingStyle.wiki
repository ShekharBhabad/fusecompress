The coding style currently in use in FuseCompress is roughly:

  * Tab indentation, tab size 8
  * braces get their own line
  * both `//` and `/* */`-style comments are allowed

You can get a good approximation using indent like so:

{{{
indent -bad -bap -nbbb -bl -bls -cdw -ce -cli8 -ts8 -i8 -l112 -lc112 -ut -bli0 -npsl -npcs -nce -brs
}}}

Don't blindly trust it, though, it is not very clever and lacks some features, too.
