News:
	0.9.1.1 Buffer overflow from command line parsing fixed. Fix bug that
	        caused permition problems on read-only files.
	0.9.1 File format has been changed. It allows better cooperation with
	      file and magic utility.
	0.9.0 First release that can be marked as stable. Many bugs fixed.
	0.8.8 User can choose compression method via program parameter.
	0.8.7 Correct rename bug, don't freeze on unmounting when in debug mode.
	0.8.6 Correct time of last status chnage, correct cleaning during unmount.
	      Remove hard-coded minimal filesize for compressing.
	0.8.4 Support lzo compression.
	0.8.3 Problem with files bigger than 2GB fixed.

Todo:
	- Optimalization
	- 7zip compression module

Instalation & compilation:

make release

Usage:

	fusecompress [OPTIONS] /storage/directory/

		-h			print this help
		-c lzo/bz2/gz/null	choose default compression method
		-o ...			pass arguments to fuse library

	You can mount filesystem over existing directory with files.
	Files will be compressed when you work with filesystem. Even
	simple 'find /storage' compress them. Note that several last files
	founded are not compressed - this is called cache and increase
	performance on frequently accessed files. These files are compressed
	when filesystem is unmounted.

Useful parameters for fuse library:

	Fuse library must be configured to support this features - configuration
	file /etc/fuse.conf must contains at least this option: user_allow_other.

	allow_other
	
		This option overrides the security measure restricting file access
		to the user mounting the filesystem.  So all users (including root)
		can access the files.  This option is by default only allowed to
		root, but this restriction can be removed with a configuration
		option described in the previous section.
	
	allow_root
	
		This option is similar to 'allow_other' but file access is limited
		to the user mounting the filesystem and root.  This option and
		'allow_other' are mutually exclusive.

Tips and tricks:

	How to obtain compression ratio?

		Run this command in the FuseCompress(ed) directory when mounted
		with FuseCompress:
			du -sh
			du -sh --apparent-size
		First command prints total uncompressed size of all files in current directory
		and its subdirectories while second one prints total compressed size.

		When FuseCompress not running run `ls -l my_file.dat` and compare file size
		with value abtained with `file my_file.dat`.

File and magic utilities:

Put this config into ~/.magic or /etc/magic file to allow file utility
recognize FuseCompress file format:

0       string  \037\135\211    FuseCompress(ed) data
>3      byte    0x00    (null format)
>3      byte    0x01    (bz2 format)
>3      byte    0x02    (gz format)
>3      byte    0x03    (lzo format)
>3      byte    >0x03   (unknown format)
>4      long    x       uncompressed size: %d
