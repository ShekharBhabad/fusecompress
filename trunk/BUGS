Hardlinks:
The second read() on file "b" in test/link.c doesn't get through to us. FUSE
seems to assume instead that the data is still the same as when reading it
the first time. This is a bug in FUSE, NTFS-3G exhibits the same problem. It
is triggered by Firefox and probably other software doing funny stuff with
hardlinks.
If you use FuseCompress as your root filesystem, you may want to
put /tmp in tmpfs.

direct_rename():
This function tries to reroute all pointers to the original file object to
the new one. Subsequently it asserts that there are no more accesses to the
original file. When running dbench I once saw that assertion fail. This is
very hard to reproduce. May be a locking issue.

errors in compressed data:
Error handling in the compression modules is not good. For cut-off data, for
instance, LZO returns an error on the first try, but zero on subsequent
tries. LZMA always returns zero. This can lead to (virtually) endless loops
in some applications. We are trying to return a serious error (EIO) if we
detect corrupt compressed data, but that does not keep some programs from
trying over and over.
